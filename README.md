* This is **DoctorWho**, **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Managing patient records, medical conditions, and allergies. 
  * Scheduling appointment system with conflict warnings.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _DoctorWho_) used for managing patient and appointment details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `DoctorWho` as a play on words, as well as a reference to the popular pop culture icon.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[DoctorWho Product Website](https://ay2526s2-cs2103t-f10-1.github.io/tp/)**.
